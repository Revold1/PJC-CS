# H2 Computing
Collection of examples and assignment code written in Python 3 for H2 Computing in Pioneer Junior College (2014-15).

**Note:** This repository has been deprecated/abandoned since 1st October 2015. It is still public for reference by future students (and to remind myself of my not-so-optimal code).
